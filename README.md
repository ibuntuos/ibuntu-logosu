 Plymouth theme for Version 3 and beyond

To edit this plymouth theme (i.e. if you want to add a different logo):

You need to edit every single png file in here. I did this with paint.net.
Yes I used a windows tool, shame on me but in my defense, paint.net together
with tinytask.exe is a good combination for such anoying tasks.
